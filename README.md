# 🍽️ SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Restaurant Orders  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves **SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a restaurant dataset to extract meaningful insights into **customer behavior, sales trends, and menu performance**. Using SQL queries, I analyzed **popular dishes, pricing strategies, and revenue patterns** to help optimize restaurant operations.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✅ Identify **peak sales periods** for better restaurant management.  
✅ Determine **best-selling and least-ordered menu items**.  
✅ Calculate **average pricing per category** to optimize pricing strategies.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **SQL (MySQL)**

## 🗂️ Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of the following key tables:  
- `menu_items` → Contains details of menu items,

## 🔍 Key SQL Techniques Used  
🔹 **Aggregations** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) to analyze order trends and revenue.  
🔹 **CTEs & Subqueries** to structure and optimize queries.  
🔹 **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`) for ranking best-selling items.  
🔹 **Joins** (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) to merge menu and order data for insights.  

## 📊 Insights & Findings  
✔️ **Peak Sales Hours**: Identified **busiest hours and days** for better staffing.  
✔️ **Most Ordered Items**: Highlighted the **top revenue-generating dishes**.  
✔️ **Pricing Analysis**: Assessed category-wise **average pricing for revenue optimization**.
